,2,Provides a partially accurate explanation but may need more details or use imprecise language.,3,"The ideal gas law works well for gases at low pressure, but things get slightly cramped at high pressure. Gas molecules have some size, and when you push them together a lot, it affects how much space they have to move around. This can make the pressure slightly higher than the ideal gas law predicts.",https://commons.libretexts.org/book
,3,"Provides a clear, concise, and scientifically accurate explanation of how nonzero atomic volume affects the ideal gas law at high pressure. Discusses the concepts of reduced available volume and increased intermolecular interactions.",4,"The ideal gas law assumes negligible atomic volume and no interactions between gas molecules. At high pressure, these assumptions become less valid. Gas molecules have a non-zero volume, and when squeezed closer together at high pressure, the available space for movement within the container (V) is effectively reduced. This is because the volume occupied by the molecules becomes more significant than the total container volume. Additionally, increased intermolecular interactions, neglected in the ideal gas law, can come into play at high pressure. While not as substantial as the excluded volume effect, these interactions can slightly influence the pressure-volume relationship.",https://commons.libretexts.org/book
